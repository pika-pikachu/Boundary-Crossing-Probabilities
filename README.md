# Boundary-Crossing-Probabilities
This repository contains scripts related to approximations of the probability a stochastic process will hit a time dependent boundary before a finite time. Our main tool is based on Markov chains, and thus we focus our approximations on Markov processes - in particular Diffusion processes.
