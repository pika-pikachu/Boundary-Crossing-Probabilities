OU_one_sided_exp_decay_boundary_midpoint_correction_1BBC.jl
- Returns the Markov chain approximated probability an Ornstein Uhlenbeck trajectory crosses an exponentially decaying boundary
- Uses a one-piece Brownian Bridge Correction (BBC) 
- Uses a midpoint correction for the state space
- Uses a boundary dependent state space
- Contains exact value for comparison
- Plots the convergence behaviour of the Markov chain approximation
