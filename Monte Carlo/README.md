monte_carlo_conv_rate_check_borovkov_2005.jl
- Borovkov & Novikov (2005) proved that the convergence rate of the boundary crossing probability with a linear approximation of the boundary is O(n^{-2})
- This script numerically verifies this result through a Monte Carlo simulation of E[f(X_t)]
- The exact BCP uses the Daniel's boundary result
- Displays cool animation of the convergence
